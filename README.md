# Cyto Logic

A compiler framework for synthetic biology that transforms high-level biological logic into genetic circuit representations.

> **Current Status:** Phases 1–4 completed. Phase 5 (Validation & Publication) completed.

---

## Overview

Cyto Logic is an experimental compiler infrastructure designed for synthetic biology. The project explores a compiler-oriented approach to genetic circuit engineering, where biological logic is treated similarly to source code in a traditional programming language.

Instead of directly generating DNA sequences from user input, Cyto Logic separates the compilation process into independent stages. A logic expression is parsed into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), transformed into a Circuit Intermediate Representation (CIR), and later consumed by different backend systems such as simulation, optimization, and biological exporters.

The long-term goal is to build a reusable compiler platform that can support multiple biological programming languages and multiple output targets without redesigning the entire system.

---

## Motivation

Most synthetic biology software combines circuit design, simulation, and exporting into tightly coupled workflows. While this approach works for specific applications, it becomes difficult to extend as projects grow.

Cyto Logic follows a different philosophy.

The compiler frontend is responsible only for understanding biological logic. Every later stage works on a common intermediate representation rather than the original source code. This separation allows simulation, optimization, validation, and export systems to evolve independently.

The architecture is inspired by modern compiler infrastructures such as LLVM, adapted for synthetic biology.

```

Every major subsystem has a single responsibility.

The frontend never communicates directly with simulation or exporters.

All downstream systems consume the Circuit Intermediate Representation.

---

# Compiler Frontend

The frontend consists of three sequential stages.

## Lexer

The lexer converts raw source text into a sequence of tokens.

Each token stores

- Type
- Value
- Source position

---

## Parser

The parser consumes the token stream and constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

The AST represents the logical structure of a biological circuit without including implementation-specific information.

---

## Semantic Analysis

The semantic analysis stage validates biologically meaningful rules.

Examples include

- Undefined proteins
- Invalid gate arity
- Incorrect circuit structure

---

# Circuit Intermediate Representation (CIR)

The Circuit IR is the core abstraction inside Cyto Logic.

Instead of allowing every backend to consume the AST directly, all compiler outputs are transformed into a graph-based intermediate representation.

Each CIR node stores

- Unique identifier
- Gate type
- Parent and child relationships
- Metadata
- Biological parameters (future)

The CIR acts as the single source of truth throughout the compiler.

---

# Project Philosophy

Cyto Logic is designed as reusable compiler infrastructure rather than a single-purpose application.

The architecture follows several principles.

- Stateless compiler stages
- Modular components
- Layer separation
- Replaceable backends
- Shared intermediate representation
- Independent simulation
- Independent optimization
- Extensible export system

---

---

# Mathematical Foundation

Future simulation is based on deterministic Ordinary Differential Equations using Hill kinetics.

Optimization will use NSGA-II to search for parameter sets that balance

- Desired expression
- Metabolic burden
- Robustness

These mathematical models are specified in the architecture but have not yet been implemented.
